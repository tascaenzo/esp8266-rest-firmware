  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This project provides a lightweight and deterministic automation firmware
      designed specifically for ESP8266-based boards such as ESP-01, ESP-12,
      NodeMCU, and Wemos D1 Mini.
    </p>

    <p>
      The firmware exposes a JSON-based REST API that allows external clients to
      configure GPIOs, schedule actions, inspect device state, and manage
      system-level settings.
      <br />
      Special care has been taken to ensure that all operations remain suitable
      for <strong>low-memory embedded environments</strong>, avoiding dynamic
      allocation patterns and unpredictable execution paths.

  <!-- DESIGN GOALS -->
  <section>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Design Goals</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">
      The firmware is built around a small set of strict design principles.
      These constraints guide both the internal architecture and the exposed API
      surface.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>Predictable and deterministic runtime behavior</li>
      <li>Bounded memory usage with no unbounded heap growth</li>
      <li>Stateless REST API suitable for automation systems</li>
      <li>Replay-safe authentication without TLS overhead</li>
      <li>Persistent configuration with automatic restore on reboot</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- SECURITY -->
  <section>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Security Model</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">
      To avoid the complexity and memory overhead of TLS, the firmware
      implements an optional authentication layer based on a nonce-driven HMAC
      mechanism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each authenticated request is signed using a one-time nonce and a shared
      secret stored securely on the device. Nonces are single-use, time-limited,
      and bound to the client IP address, making replay attacks infeasible even
      on unencrypted networks.
    </p>

  <!-- DEVICE OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Connected Device Overview</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      When a device is connected, the console retrieves and displays live
      information directly from the firmware. This provides immediate visibility
      into the current system state and runtime conditions.
    </p>

  <!-- CONSOLE PURPOSE -->
  <section>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">What You Can Do in This Console</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">
      This web console is designed as a companion tool for developers and system
      integrators working with the firmware. It is not intended as a generic
      end-user interface, but as a technical inspection and experimentation
      environment.
    </p>

      <li>Inspect the live state of the device and all GPIOs</li>
      <li>Explore authenticated and unauthenticated API behavior</li>
      <li>Study request signing and payload rules</li>
      <li>Debug GPIO modes, safety levels, and cron execution</li>
      <li>Configure system-level settings and authentication</li>
